## Idea

This was a project that normally we have 3 months for do it. but we are a little busy and we have just 1 month to do, because of this we need to run with all the step but in the end all goes good
The Most Complex part was think what part of the backend will be a indiviual backend inside of our microservice, in the end we have auth, game, user, tournament, stats services where the major of then post in a queue the changes for other calculation behind the scences.
